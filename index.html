    <h2>Github Pages</h2>
    <p>I think I've managed to figure out the beginnings of the whole "GitHub Pages" thing.</p>
    <p>The first GH site I should establish for my account is the one that's basically <b>${username}.github.io</b>&mdash;that's my <i>user site</i>. From there, any other "sites" I build will be a <em>project site</em>.</p>
    <p>I'm thinking that my first site should house links to all of my other projects, especially if I'm trying to showcase what I can do on the front-end.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes made to GH Pages</h2>
    <p>Changes made to GH page content take a minute or two to actually update. Don't freak if your site doesn't update immediately!</p>
